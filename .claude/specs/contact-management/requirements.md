# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Telegram Contact Management system that enables users to discover, organize, and communicate with contacts from all Telegram chats (including group chats). The system will provide comprehensive contact information, tagging capabilities, and bulk messaging functionality based on tags.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Contact Discovery and Aggregation

**User Story:** As a Telegram user, I want the system to automatically discover and aggregate all my contacts from all chats (including group chats), so that I have a centralized view of everyone I interact with on Telegram.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL scan all private chats, group chats, and supergroups to identify unique contacts
2. WHEN a contact appears in multiple chats THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into a single contact record
3. WHEN new chats are created or joined THEN the system SHALL automatically update the contact list
4. WHEN a contact is found THEN the system SHALL extract and store their user ID, username, display name, profile photo, and phone number (if available)

### Requirement 2: Contact Profile Viewing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view detailed information about each contact, so that I can understand my relationship and interaction history with them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a contact THEN the system SHALL display the contact's profile image
2. WHEN viewing a contact profile THEN the system SHALL display a list of all mutual groups (groups where both the user and contact are members)
3. WHEN displaying the list of mutual groups THEN the system SHALL display the group name, the number of members in each group, and the group profile image.
4. WHEN viewing a contact profile THEN the system SHALL display the last message the contact sent to the user (with timestamp)
5. WHEN viewing a contact profile THEN the system SHALL display the last message the user sent to the contact (with timestamp)
6. IF a profile image is not available THEN the system SHALL display a default placeholder image
7. IF no mutual groups exist THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message indicating no shared groups
8. IF no message history exists THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message indicating no message history

### Requirement 3: Contact Tagging System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add custom tags to my contacts, so that I can organize and categorize them based on my own criteria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the contact list THEN the user SHALL be able to add one or more tags to any contact
2. WHEN adding a tag THEN the system SHALL allow the user to create a new tag or select from existing tags
3. WHEN a tag is added to a contact THEN the system SHALL persist this association
4. WHEN viewing a contact THEN the system SHALL display all tags assigned to that contact
5. WHEN a user removes a tag from a contact THEN the system SHALL remove the association immediately
6. WHEN displaying tags THEN the system SHALL show them in a visually distinct manner (e.g., colored labels or badges)

### Requirement 4: Contact List Display and Filtering

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view all my contacts in an organized list with filtering capabilities, so that I can easily find and manage specific contacts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the contact list THEN the system SHALL display all discovered contacts
2. WHEN displaying contacts THEN the system SHALL show at minimum: name, username, and assigned tags
3. WHEN the user searches for a contact THEN the system SHALL filter the list based on name, username, or tags
4. WHEN the user filters by tag THEN the system SHALL display only contacts with that specific tag
5. WHEN the contact list is empty THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating no contacts have been found

### Requirement 5: Tag-Based Bulk Messaging

**User Story:** As a user, I want to send messages to multiple contacts based on their tags, so that I can efficiently communicate with groups of people without creating formal Telegram groups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing contacts THEN the user SHALL have an option to send messages to contacts by tag
2. WHEN the user selects to send a message by tag THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to select one or more tags
3. WHEN tags are selected THEN the system SHALL display the list of contacts that will receive the message
4. WHEN the user confirms THEN the system SHALL send the message to all selected contacts as individual direct messages
5. WHEN sending messages THEN the system SHALL provide progress feedback indicating how many messages have been sent
6. IF a message fails to send to a contact THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue sending to remaining contacts
7. WHEN all messages are sent THEN the system SHALL display a summary showing successful and failed deliveries

### Requirement 6: Telegram API Authentication and Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to securely authenticate with Telegram, so that the system can access my chats and contacts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user first launches the application THEN the system SHALL prompt for Telegram API credentials (API ID and API hash)
2. WHEN API credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL initiate the Telegram authentication flow
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL request the user's phone number
4. WHEN a phone number is submitted THEN the system SHALL send a verification code via Telegram
5. WHEN the verification code is entered THEN the system SHALL complete the authentication process
6. IF two-factor authentication is enabled THEN the system SHALL prompt for the 2FA password
7. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL securely store the session for future use
8. WHEN the session expires THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to re-authenticate

### Requirement 7: Data Synchronization and Updates

**User Story:** As a user, I want my contact information to stay up-to-date with Telegram, so that I always see current information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a contact's profile information changes on Telegram THEN the system SHALL update the stored information
2. WHEN the user manually triggers a refresh THEN the system SHALL re-scan all chats and update contact information
3. WHEN new messages are exchanged THEN the system SHALL update the "last message" information for affected contacts
4. WHEN a user leaves or is removed from a group THEN the system SHALL update the mutual groups list for all affected contacts

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when errors occur, so that I understand what went wrong and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Telegram API is unreachable THEN the system SHALL display an error message and suggest troubleshooting steps
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display a specific error message indicating the reason
3. WHEN a message fails to send THEN the system SHALL notify the user and provide the option to retry
4. WHEN rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL inform the user and automatically retry after the appropriate delay
5. IF the application crashes THEN the system SHALL preserve user data and session information
6. WHEN an unexpected error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the error details for debugging purposes
